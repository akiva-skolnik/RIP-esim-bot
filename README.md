# Discord Bot For The [e-sim](https://alpha.e-sim.org) Browser Game

## Overview

This Discord bot enhances the player experience for the browser game [e-sim](https://alpha.e-sim.org) by providing
exclusive insights, graphs, and integrated data.

It utilizes a caching mechanism powered by MySQL for improved performance.

This project has been a significant part of my learning journey in Python, and I'm continually refining it to provide
better features and performance, even though I no longer play the game.

## Key Features:

* **Extensive Command List:** The bot boasts a wide range of commands that offer valuable information and tools to
  players (see image below for reference).
* **Data Visualization:** Complex data is presented in clear and concise graphs for easy understanding.
* **Integrated Information:** Seamlessly access game data directly within Discord, eliminating the need to switch
  between platforms.
* **MySQL Cache:** Ensures efficient data retrieval and reduces API calls.
* **Cloud-Hosted:** The bot runs on a reliable cloud server, funded by generous users.
* **Community-Driven:** Over 500,000 commands have been executed, demonstrating its popularity and usefulness.
